# Taxi data project
Visualization of taxi data collected during March 2013 in the Stockholm region of Sweden. Project in TNM048 at Link√∂pings University. The goal was to visualize how a specific car has driven and number of times it got hired.

##Data
The data has the following attributes:
Taxi ID, time stamp, latitude, longitude and hired/not hired

~1500 cars
~13 million samples.
Sampled every minute during a month. 

##Datamining
Grid cluster has been used to reduced the amount of data on the screen. The amount of samples in each grid cluster will be represented by three different sized circles.
